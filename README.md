# Test Harness

The test harness provides code necessary to learn, test, and analyze the combination of Gunicorn WSGI, Python Django, RDBMS/Sqlite3, Celery, MongoDB, an R-base modeling environment, and Docker-base containers

Objectives: better understand legacy system & dependencies. Move to updated versions. Containerize to increase availability of test environments, lower the cost of running the environment, while meeting data security requirements.



## Individual Tests and Protypes 

* Test1 -- Prerequisite python literacy, especially subprocesses as used in legacy architecture.  
* Test2 -- 
* Test3
* Test4

## Application Development
